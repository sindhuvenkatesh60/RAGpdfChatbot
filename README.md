Perfect 👍 This time your RAG app uses **FAISS (local vector store)** instead of Qdrant Cloud.
Here’s a detailed **README.md** tailored for this project:

# 📄 RAG Chatbot with FAISS + Ollama

A **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot** built using:

* [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) for the interactive UI
* [FAISS](https://faiss.ai/) (local vector store) for efficient similarity search
* [LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/) for orchestration
* [Ollama](https://ollama.ai/) to run **LLaMA 3.2** locally as the LLM

Upload a **PDF file**, and the chatbot will let you ask natural language questions about its contents.
The text is **chunked, embedded, stored in FAISS locally**, and retrieved for accurate answers.

---

## 🚀 Features

* Extracts text from uploaded **PDFs**
* Splits text into **semantic chunks** for better retrieval
* Generates embeddings with **HuggingFace Sentence Transformers**
* Stores & retrieves vectors from **FAISS (local)**
* Runs **LLaMA 3.2** (via Ollama) to generate responses
* Interactive **Streamlit web UI**

## 📦 Installation

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/rag-chatbot-faiss-ollama.git
cd rag-chatbot-faiss-ollama
```

### 2. Create a virtual environment

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # Mac/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate      # Windows
```

### 3. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

`requirements.txt` should include:

```
streamlit
PyPDF2
langchain
sentence-transformers
faiss-cpu
ollama
```

---

## ▶️ Run the App

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

Then open the local URL in your browser (usually `http://localhost:8501`).

---

## 🖼️ Usage

1. Upload a **PDF**
2. The app extracts text → splits into chunks → creates embeddings → stores in **FAISS**
3. Ask any question about the PDF in the text box
4. The app retrieves relevant chunks → passes them to **LLaMA (via Ollama)** → displays the answer

## ⚡ Example Workflow

1. Upload `research_paper.pdf`
2. Ask: *“What is the main contribution of this paper?”*
3. The chatbot retrieves relevant sections and answers using **LLaMA 3.2**

---

## 🔮 Future Improvements

* Support for **multiple PDFs**
* Add support for **images (OCR)**
* More advanced **retrieval strategies** (hybrid search, reranking, etc.)
* Deployment on **Streamlit Cloud / Docker**

👉 Do you want me to also give you a **ready-to-use `requirements.txt` file** so you don’t have to manually figure out the exact versions?
